<font size="5" color="red"><b>Research Associates/Postdoctoral Fellows for Global Mining Watch</b></font>

_Full-time, fixed-term for 1 year (can be extended to another year)_

We are looking for 3 Research Associates/Postdoctoral Fellows (RAs) to work on a multidisciplinary research project on ‘Global Mining Watch’, bringing together expertise in remote sensing, computer vision, GIS, ecology, and social science. The aim of the project is to perform remote sensing, geo-spatial and socio-environmental analysis of global mining footprints, supporting social impact and risk assessment of mining sites around the world. The project will utilise cutting-edge computer vision and deep-learning approaches, GIS analysis of global data and new approaches to web-based mapping and visualisation of socio-ecological environmental challenges. The project under the ‘Global Mining Watch’ umbrella will be funded from multiple funding bodies, including Google Research Scholar Award, Ford Foundation, and joint initiative between Monash University Indonesia and the University of Queensland.

Three RAs will be employed on the project focusing on different disciplinary areas: Computer vision, GIS and remote sensing analyses using Python/R/Javascript and GIS analysis. As an RA on this project, you will work under the supervision of [Dr. Risqi Saputra](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/about-monash-in-indonesia/our-people/Muhamad-Risqi-Saputra) and [Dr. Alex Lechner](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/about-monash-in-indonesia/our-people/alex-lechner). The position is based at [Monash University Indonesia](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia), a research intensive university, ranked #57 in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2022.

You will have excellent communication skills in English, both in verbal and in writing. Specific requirements for particular position will be described as follows:
