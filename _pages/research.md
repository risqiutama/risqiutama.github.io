My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine (deep) learning, computer vision, and cyber-physical systems, with applications spanning navigation, positioning, mapping, object detection, and semantic segmentation, among other areas. Additionally, I am also interested in interdisciplinary research that integrates these core domains with diverse fields such as disaster prevention and management, environmental monitoring, health sciences, assistive technologies, and smart cities. These interdisciplinary efforts aim to address real-world challenges while leveraging advances in AI and data science.

Within these research areas, my work can be broadly categorized into two main domains: 1) fundamental AI and data science, and 2) interdisciplinary applications. In many cases, the focus is on developing AI and data science techniques to address interdisciplinary challenges.

<font size="4" color="green"><b>Intelligent Remote Sensing for Sustainable Flood Risk Management and Policy</b></font>

This research seeks to develop an intelligent remote sensing system that can segment and map the temporal dynamics of flooding on a daily basis using AI-based remote sensing approaches to help assess flood impacts and design more sustainable flood management policies. Our study is situated in Indonesia’s upper Citarum river basin where land use change has led to the occurrence of annual flooding events.
