I am an Associate Professor in Data Science and AI at [Monash University, Indonesia](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/cyberphysical/) within the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, UK, where I also completed my DPhil (PhD). Before coming to Oxford, I obtained bachelor and master degree (M.Eng) from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. In the past, I co-founded [LexiPal Indonesia](http://lexipalindonesia.com) and served as a Senior (Lead) Data Scientist at Jakarta Smart City.

Research Interest
======
My main research interest revolves around the intersection between computer vision, machine (deep) learning, and cyber-physical systems, applied to a wide range of problems including navigation, positioning, mapping, object detection, or semantic segmentation, among others. Nevertheless, I am also keen to explore diverse interdisciplinary applications that intersect with my primary research interests, including (but not limited to) disaster response and prevention, environmental monitoring, assistive technology, health science, and smart cities.

I am always open to collaborations with individuals from academia or industry and am actively seeking PhD students. Feel free to contact me via email!
