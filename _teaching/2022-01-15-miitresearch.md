Description: The aim of the unit is to prepare Masters students to conduct research across the range of IT sub-disciplines. It provides broad coverage of the issues, concepts, methods, and techniques associated with Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Systems and Information Management research. It introduces students to major research paradigms, the principles of research design, research ethics, and research methods and techniques of data collection and analysis appropriate to IT research generally and to their sub-discipline specifically. It covers oral, written, online and video research communication skills. Skills developed and knowledge acquired from this unit will prepare students to conduct and communicate their own research, as well as to be knowledgeable and critical interpreters of research more generally.
