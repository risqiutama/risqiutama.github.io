Role: Lab Demonstrator.

Description: This course introduces the field of machine learning, focusing on the core concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the course discusses algorithms which are trained on input data labelled with a desired output and learn a function mapping from the input to the output. Unsupervised learning aims to discover latent structure in an input signal where no output labels are available. The Lab will concern on the application of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, naive bayes, and basic deep learning for image classification.
