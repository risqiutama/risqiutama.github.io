Role: Lecturer.

Description: “Internet of Things” can be defined as a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information network, and where the physical objects can become active participants in business processes (Weber et al., 2010). This course examines the fundamental properties of wireless communication and its protocol (physical layers, medium access control, routing, etc.) within the context of IoT. This course focuses on the "things" that actually create and deliver the data, and place less emphasis on the "internet" side of the IoT. This subject also discusses IoT applications for position estimation based on WiFi, magneto-inductive, vision, thermal, and others, either using conventional fingerprinting approaches or emerging techniques like deep learning.
