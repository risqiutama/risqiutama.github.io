Role: Lecturer (2022 ~ 2024)

Description: This unit is designed to enable students to apply their core program skills to a real-world problem, harnessing the power of data for social impact. Students will work in teams, drawing from publicly available data to address a specific challenge faced by society, business, or government. Each team will present the final results of their project to an expert panel of assessors. The unit will develop thinkers who combine evidence-based solutions with persuasive communication and visualization. Students will meet before the term commences to draft their project proposals and identify data sources.
