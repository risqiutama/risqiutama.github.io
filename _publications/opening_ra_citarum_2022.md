<font size="5" color="red"><b>[1] Research Associates and Research Assistant Positions Available</b></font>

_Full-time/Part-time, 6-12 months (with potential extension)_

We are looking for Research Assistant/Associates (RAs) to work on a range of multidisciplinary research projects assessing the value of nature in a range of contexts drawing on remote sensing, GIS, ecology, and social sciences. You will contribute to a number of projects which include: mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services in cities, conducting multi-criteria decision analysis for sustainable regional planning and wildlife connectivity modelling. The project will utilise cutting-edge GIS analyses drawing on emerging approaches to spatial planning, landscape ecology and regional development including nature-based solutions, urban ecosystem services and socio-ecological systems approaches. A second related project will apply computer vision approaches, particularly using machine learning, to mapping flooding.

As an RA on this project, you will work under the supervision of [Dr. Risqi Saputra](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/about-monash-in-indonesia/our-people/Muhamad-Risqi-Saputra) and [Dr. Alex Lechner](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/about-monash-in-indonesia/our-people/alex-lechner). However, you will work closely with other academic staff in a variety of areas at Monash Indonesia, Monash Australia, and Monash Malaysia.
